# LLM Context Compressor

## Vision

The goal of this project is to create a **hybrid system to efficiently compress and manage LLM chat context**, aiming to:

- Reduce token usage while retaining essential conversation information
- Make LLM-based chats more cost-effective and scalable
- Explore novel techniques combining preprocessing, semantic embeddings, and lightweight summarization

This repository serves as a **research and experimental platform**, where different strategies for context compression will be explored to find what works best.

## Current Status

- Planning and vision phase
- Experimentation and implementation to follow
- Focus is on exploring, iterating, and optimizing compression techniques

---

## Long-Term Goals

- Enable longer, coherent, and more efficient LLM conversations
- Publish findings on effective context compression strategies
- Create a reusable library for AI developers and researchers
- enable broader adoption in chatbots , customer supports etc ..
